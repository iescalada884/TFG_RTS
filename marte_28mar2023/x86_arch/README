			  Architecture "x86"
                         --------------------

This directory contains the code specific for the architecture "x86".

When  compiled   for  this   architecture,  a  MaRTE   OS  application
("mprogram") takes the form of a x86 ELF executable file that includes
both operating system and user's application code.

It is a stand-alone program that can be executed in a bare-machine x86
PC.
