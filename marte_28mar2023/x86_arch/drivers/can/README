                CAN driver for MaRTE OS
                =======================
                   by Daniel Sangorrin

1. Introduction
===============

This driver has been developed to support CAN bus on MaRTE OS. The driver
is composed of code for each supported board (files with name board_xxx.[h,c]),
each supported chip (files with name chip_xxxx.[h,c]) and a glue that
puts them together (example: a pc is composed of several boards and each board
has several chips). Each type of board and chip has to implement a set of
interface functions.

This idea has been taken from the Lincan project (also some bits of
code) but the interface and code is different because we want to provide a
simple and very thin implementation with prioritized queues to develope
real-time protocols on top of it. This interface may change a little bit as
support for more cards and chips is added in the future.

To access the driver you can use the functions:

  - create: searches for any supported board in the node and initializes it
  - open: initializes a chip (each can bus chip corresponds to a minor number)
  - write: write a msg in the can prioritized buffers.
  - read: read a msg from the current can channel buffer (set with ioctl)
  - ioctl:
        + SET_CHANNEL = sets the channel that you want to read
        + SET_ACCEPTANCE_FILTER = changes the acceptance filters
        + GET_STATUS = gets the status and errors in the bus

2. Supported CARDS
==================

- Adlink PCI 7841

3. Supported Chipsets
=====================

- SJA1000 (PeliCAN mode)

4. Support
==========

The driver does not have official support, it is distributed as it is without
any warranty and the license is the same as MaRTE OS license. You can ask any
question in the MaRTE OS Website forum.
