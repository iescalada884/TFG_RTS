                        =======

This are the CAN driver installation instructions for MaRTE OS:

   - At "x86_arch/arch_dependent_files/marte-configuration_parameters.ads"
     check that there is enough room in the table for adding a new driver.

        Devices_Files_Mx : constant := 19;
        Devices_Mx : constant := 14;

   - Modify the file "x86_arch/arch_dependent_files/marte-devices_table.ads"
     in order to include the CAN driver.

     ...
     with CAN_Driver_Import;
     ...
     package MaRTE.Kernel.Devices_Table is
     ...
     --  CAN driver
     14 => (Name   => "CAN driver      ",
            Create => CAN_Driver_Import.Create_Ac,
            Remove => CAN_Driver_Import.Remove_Ac,
            Open   => CAN_Driver_Import.Open_Ac,
            Close  => CAN_Driver_Import.Close_Ac,
            Read   => CAN_Driver_Import.Read_Ac,
            Write  => CAN_Driver_Import.Write_Ac,
            Ioctl  => CAN_Driver_Import.Ioctl_Ac,
            Delete => null,
            Lseek  => null),
     ...
     18 => ("/dev/can0       ", 14, 0, True, Device, False, 0),
     19 => ("/dev/can1       ", 14, 1, True, Device, False, 0),

   - Now that the driver is inserted in MaRTE OS, we have to (re)install it

     $ ./minstall

     Select the x86 architecture.

If you are improving or modifying the CAN driver, you don't need to recompile
the whole MaRTE OS kernel, only the drivers. To do so you can call "mkdrivers"
