Abstract

ZigBee is becoming a very important protocol to create short range wireless networks
with low data transmission rate and low power consumption, in order to interconnect
devices (robots, controllers, actuators, sensors, etc), to perform a particular task.
This final project develops a library written in c language that gives the user the
operations that he needs to create and manage a pan network using the ZigBee protocol
and ensure that this library can be used in any operating system that provides the POSIX
interface, including real-time operating systems as MaRTE. To do that we have several
devices, which consist of a module xbee series 2 and a board with rs-232 and USB
connection.

One goal of this project is to create a wireless network between several devices which can
work in different operating systems. In our case, MaRTE OS does not have implemented
the controller serial port usb so we will connect the devices with serial port rs-232
to MaRTE operating system and the devices with serial port USB connection to Linux
operating system.

As demonstration that anyone can use our library for the creation and management of
wireless networks using the ZigBee protocol, we have included in our project a
demonstration of controlling the motions of a robot microbiro, which we will send packets
with the instructions.
