     claimed to include because a mistake when doing the distribution,
     now they are included
   * Added drivers for the CAN bus (see x86_arch/drivers/can)
   * There has been a big renaming in the files of MaRTE OS. For instance
     all the kernel filenames now have a "marte-" prefix to avoid
     name collisions (this was a requirement for the inclusion of
     MaRTE OS in AdaCore GNAT distribution), the hardware interface is
     now called HAL, the task inspector is now marte-spy, etc..
   * There are some small libraries added in misc/ directory like a
     library for taking time measurements, a logger (for example, you
     can log bytes to a Linux host through the Ethernet), a freelist
     (useful to preallocate elements in a pool and then get/free them
     in O(1) time) and Linux kernel-like linked lists.
