                         'task_inspector' Tool
                        =======================

This tool allows analyzing the execution flow of an application. The
relevant scheduling information is sent from the target to the host
computer across the serial line, being stored to be analyzed after the
application execution finishes.

The scheduling information is parsed and transformed into a set of
files that can serve as input for 'gnuplot', a plotting program with
which the information is displayed graphically.

For information about how to use the 'task_inspector' tool look at the
'marte_ug.txt' document.
