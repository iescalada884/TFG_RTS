This is a very simple oscilloscope to monitor data.

- README: this file

- Makefile: script to compile the tests (make test_xxx.exe)

- oscilloscope.[h, c]: the code for the oscilloscope. It requires the library
  svga (which is available in MaRTE OS for the x86 architecture). The
  interface is very simple, check the example tests provided

- test_oscilloscope.c: a simple test that shows a sine on the oscilloscope

- test_oscilloscope_mouse.c: a test that monitors on the oscilloscope the value
  of the coordinate 'y' of the mouse (you must install the driver for the
  mouse device in marte-kernel-devices_table.ads and recompile MaRTE OS)

- mouse_bindings.ad[s,b]: this is part of the test_oscilloscope_mouse and is
  used to communicate with the mouse driver in Ada because there is no C
  interface available for that driver right now.
