Simple Chess for MaRTE OS
=========================

A simple single-player chess game for MaRTE OS with two modes available: text and GUI.

The heart of this program (the artificial intelligence) comes from the open source command-line program mscp by Marcel van Kervinck (http://marcelk.net/mscp/). I ported it to MaRTE OS, made some small modifications and created a graphical interface based on the one I made for EtherChess.

Current state: both modes, text and GUI, work but some details aren't completely finished.
