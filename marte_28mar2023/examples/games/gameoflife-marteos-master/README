GoLife is an implementation of John Conway's "Game of Life" 
for MaRTE OS and my little tribute to the original MIT hackers,
specially Bill Gosper.

"The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton 
devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is 
the best-known example of a cellular automaton." from Wikipedia: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

Reading "Hackers: Heroes of the computer Revolution" by Steven 
Levy I learned about "Game of Life" and I thought it would be fun to make
a version for MaRTE OS. Here's my quick implementation.

0- INSTALLATION:

A makefile is provided to easily generate the program, however, 
you may need to change the path to the svga driver to the one 
corresponding to your MaRTE OS installation.
