---------------------------------------------------------
Networking examples for MaRTE OS - Linux communications 
---------------------------------------------------------

*************
1. Ethernet *
*************
This example just sends data from MaRTE OS to a adhoc logger built for Linux. This example only uses the Ethernet layer so no TCP/IP nor UDPIP is involved.

Caveats:
The logger looks for a byte between the header and the payload to know whether padding has been used. Furthermore, it waits for a specific and private ETHTYPE. Other ETHTYPEs are filtered.
As a result, this logger cannot be used "as is" for regular ethernet applications. 

To execute this test, please:
 - Set MaRTE OS utils in $PATH
 - Configure the Makefile with your appropriate info
 - Configure the app with your networking info
 - >> make
 - sudo bin/linux_logger
 - run MaRTE OS app

 
************* 
2. LWIP-UDP *
*************
This example exchanges messages with a general Linux UDP server. For instance, you can use the Packet Sender tool (https://packetsender.com/) to quickly exchange data with MaRTE OS.

Caveats:
The compiltation process of lwip builds the library in the current test dir.
 

To execute this test, please:
 - Set MaRTE OS utils in $PATH
 - Configure the Makefile with your appropriate info
 - Configure the app with your networking info
 - >> make
 - ./PacketSender_Linux_x64_v5_6_1.AppImage
 - run MaRTE OS app
 
 
*************
3. LWIP-TCP *
*************
This example establish a TCP connection with a general Linux TCP server in order to exchange data. For instance, you can use the Packet Sender tool (https://packetsender.com/) to quickly exchange data with MaRTE OS.

Caveats:
The compiltation process of lwip builds the library in the current test dir.
 

To execute this test, please:
 - Set MaRTE OS utils in $PATH
 - Configure the Makefile with your appropriate info
 - Configure the app with your networking info
 - >> make
 - ./PacketSender_Linux_x64_v5_6_1.AppImage
 - run MaRTE OS app


**************
4. TODO LIST *
**************
- Ada layer to use sockets
- Integrate the lwIP library into the compilation process of MaRTE OS
- Enhance real-time features of lwIP
- Exhaustive testing
