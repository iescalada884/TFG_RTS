                     =================

  installation and the debugger.

  installation and the debugger.

  the 'task_inspector' tool.

  Application Level" API.

  play music (for x86 architecture)

- widgets/: an example that uses the svga and mouse driver to create
  different widgets (buttons, lights, ..)

- logger/: examples that use the logger utility included in the misc library

- time_measurement/: examples that use the time_measurement library included
  in the miscellanea utilities.

  driver directory there might be more tests and examples)
